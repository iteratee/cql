4.1.0.0
-------
- Drop incompatible varint
- Use persist instead of cereal to avoid reserialization. The new release of
  persist allows for length backpatching, which is exactly what the CQL native
  encoding needs.
- Add a utility function for the Cassandra Murmur3 hash
- Add rowKey function to Tuple/PrivateTuple typeclass
- Add Ord instances for newtype wrapper types
- Add Cql instance for Keyspace newtype
- Add Cql instances for Data.Word types
- Supports GHC 9.2-9.12

Breaking changes:
- persist library instead of cereal. Interface of `persist` library is very
  similar to `cereal`, so this should be easy to port.
- `putValue` has been split into `putValue` and `putValueLength`.
  `putValueLength` has the behavior that was previously handled by `putValue`.
  This separation is necessary to support token aware routing. Token aware
  routing doesn't use the length prefix on the outermost value.

4.0.2
-----
- Add missing constructors for `WriteType`.
  cf. https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/5a662ea3ffdbb9563cf3ef959deb13982b084b24
- GHC 8.8 compatibility.

4.0.1
-----
- GHC 8.4 compatibility.
- Adjust lower bound on base (>= 4.9) to reflect reality.

4.0.0
-----
- Add support for CQL V4 binary protocol.
- Remove support for CQL V2 binary protocol.
- Documentation updates.
- Bugfix: The generic 'Row' type did not account for null values
  upon decoding.
- Add a minimal stack.yaml for stack builds.

3.1.1
-----
- Fix compatibility with template-haskell 2.11.0.0

3.1.0
-----
- Bugfix: Previous versions used an encoding for `CqlVarInt`
  and `CqlDecimal` which is *incompatible* with the actual CQL binary
  protocol specification. If you want to continue using the previous
  encoding use `-f incompatible-varint` when building this release.
- The `Keyspace` parameter was removed from `UdtColumn` (for details
  see https://gitlab.com/twittner/cql/merge_requests/2)

3.0.7
-----
- Bugfix release. Fixes UDT and tuple serialisation.

3.0.6
-----
- Update `cereal` upper bound.

3.0.5
-----
- Add `Row` type to represent dynamic query parameters
  and results (e.g. to run "lightweight transactions"
  which may yield different results)

3.0.4
-----
- Update `iproute` upper bound
- Handle `SockAddrCan` from network >= 2.6.1

3.0.3
-----
- Update `iproute` upper bound

3.0.2
-----
- Add support for GHC 7.10.1
